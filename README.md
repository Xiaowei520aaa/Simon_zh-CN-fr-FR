For this practice, I aim to test my ability in game development and localization by applying my newly acquired skills in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The simplicity and interesting nature of the Simon game made it an ideal choice for this endeavor. By localizing the game into two languages, Chinese and French, I aimed to cater to a wider audience and provide an immersive experience for players who speak these languages.
